    Just some basic setup work today. Obviously, making a full express app is more setup than using create-react-app, but still a lot better than setting up everything by hand with just webpack. Even making and connecting to mongoDB is not that bad.

    Hoping I can get all the actual sign in/validation/encryption/layout working today. If I can, I can probably add all the fun stuff within a day or two.

    Authentication shit is done! Easy peasy with the TOP page and a little stackoverflow. Now for some message DB stuff.

    Yesterday was pretty productive layout-wise. Found a new site for when I need more specific icons than what feathericons has. I've decided to use a dingbat face font for generating user icons, as that seems to be the simplest way, and the dingbat font I found is pretty cute. Man I gotta shit.

    Fucking I key stopped working on my mechanical keyboard. Luckily I have a basic old one that I was using before. Might even be able to get a replacement from Amazon/the manufacturer, but not sure how long that'll take. Technically, it was a keyboard/mouse combo, so it would be dope if they sent me a full set of both. For the time being, might take some time to readjust to this keyboard.
