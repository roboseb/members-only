    Just some basic setup work today. Obviously, making a full express app is more setup than using create-react-app, but still a lot better than setting up everything by hand with just webpack. Even making and connecting to mongoDB is not that bad.

    Hoping I can get all the actual sign in/validation/encryption/layout working today. If I can, I can probably add all the fun stuff within a day or two.

    Authentication shit is done! Easy peasy with the TOP page and a little stackoverflow. Now for some message DB stuff.

    Yesterday was pretty productive layout-wise. Found a new site for when I need more specific icons than what feathericons has. I've decided to use a dingbat face font for generating user icons, as that seems to be the simplest way, and the dingbat font I found is pretty cute. Man I gotta shit.

    Fucking I key stopped working on my mechanical keyboard. Luckily I have a basic old one that I was using before. Might even be able to get a replacement from Amazon/the manufacturer, but not sure how long that'll take. Technically, it was a keyboard/mouse combo, so it would be dope if they sent me a full set of both. For the time being, might take some time to readjust to this keyboard.

    Sianvar has only released two albums and somehow they're both the greatest album ever made.

    I'd like to be done with this in a day, but it would be totally reasonably to also spend tomorrow adding more features and cleaning it up a little. Just gotta remember not to waste my time making this an actual complete clone of discord, as that's not really the point.

    Layout is pretty much done. Might update the nav a little more. Sign-up and sign-in pages look decent, and even have some custom password eye thingies.

    Channels work, most of the styling is a solid clone of discord, and I somehow got everything to scroll properly.
