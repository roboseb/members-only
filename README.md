    Just some basic setup work today. Obviously, making a full express app is more setup than using create-react-app, but still a lot better than setting up everything by hand with just webpack. Even making and connecting to mongoDB is not that bad.

    Hoping I can get all the actual sign in/validation/encryption/layout working today. If I can, I can probably add all the fun stuff within a day or two.

    Authentication shit is done! Easy peasy with the TOP page and a little stackoverflow. Now for some message DB stuff.

    Yesterday was pretty productive layout-wise. Found a new site for when I need more specific icons than what feathericons has. I've decided to use a dingbat face font for generating user icons, as that seems to be the simplest way, and the dingbat font I found is pretty cute. Man I gotta shit.

    Fucking I key stopped working on my mechanical keyboard. Luckily I have a basic old one that I was using before. Might even be able to get a replacement from Amazon/the manufacturer, but not sure how long that'll take. Technically, it was a keyboard/mouse combo, so it would be dope if they sent me a full set of both. For the time being, might take some time to readjust to this keyboard.

    Sianvar has only released two albums and somehow they're both the greatest album ever made.

    I'd like to be done with this in a day, but it would be totally reasonably to also spend tomorrow adding more features and cleaning it up a little. Just gotta remember not to waste my time making this an actual complete clone of discord, as that's not really the point.

    Layout is pretty much done. Might update the nav a little more. Sign-up and sign-in pages look decent, and even have some custom password eye thingies.

    Channels work, most of the styling is a solid clone of discord, and I somehow got everything to scroll properly.

    Welcome to the totally reasonable second day. Even though I spent more time than usual cleaning some stuff up yesterday, there's still a decent amount of work to do, mainly all the glitchy Mia stuff. And the actual members only part. But that should be pretty trivial to implement. Just need to come up with something cool for it to do.

    Miiiiight be another other day.

    Welcome to the next next day, with a totally unknown level of reasonability.

    Knock on wood, but there's really not a ton left to do, so it should be done today. The bulk of work should be adding a better mobile layout, and then really laying out the glitch "progression". Or deciding if it'll all just be specific triggers and doesn't really have an order. Not sure yet. Just need to move the glitches away from this littl debug panel to something else. I think I'll leave the button panel is as a secret somewhere though.

    Ow! (Splidao!) [I Like It, Though] by Hail the Sun is the song of the day. It's from their second album as far as I can see, so I checked out their first album, and the first song on there is conceptually cool but sounds like shit, so I will be looking at newer albums. As a side note, found out yesterday that this type of music is called post-hardcore. Much worse name than my suggestion, 'progunk'.
