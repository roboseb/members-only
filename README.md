    Just some basic setup work today. Obviously, making a full express app is more setup than using create-react-app, but still a lot better than setting up everything by hand with just webpack. Even making and connecting to mongoDB is not that bad.

    Hoping I can get all the actual sign in/validation/encryption/layout working today. If I can, I can probably add all the fun stuff within a day or two.

    Authentication shit is done! Easy peasy with the TOP page and a little stackoverflow. Now for some message DB stuff.

--To-Do---

-Fade in on scroll like fireship's video
-Add in mia
-random delete messages
-eye scrolling animations
-random change messages' data
-little password eyeball
-invalid login errors
-basic layout
-fake random user flags like, "banned", "suspended" etc.
-screen bleeding effect (overly realistic)
-message timestamp
-UI elements start bugging out
